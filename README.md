# Weather-Dashboard-App
This website provides the user with todays weather and a forecast of the upcoming five days. It does this by calling the Openweather API for data. It also used moment.js for date data. It saves a list of the cities that have been searched for. This is used to create buttons, allowing the user to quickly naviagte between their previously searched cities.

# Challenges

This was my first project using server APIs. Accessing the data and getting it to appear on the page was one of the main challenges. Dynamically creating the buttons from localstorage was probably the biggest challenge. 

# What I learned

I learned how to access multiple pieces of information from an API and get them to appear on the page using jQuery. I learned how to give multiple attributes to elements so I could give the dynamically created buttons an id and a class. I learned how to use moment.js for getting the dates for the five day forecast. 

Here is a screenshot of the application.
